# Data Cleaning and Dashboard Designing Using Excel

This repository contains a collection of files and resources related to data cleaning and dashboard designing using Microsoft Excel. 

## Overview

In this project, data cleaning and dashboard designing were performed using Microsoft Excel. The following steps were taken to prepare the data and create insightful visualizations:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Duplicate values were removed to ensure data accuracy. Values were replaced to enhance readability for stakeholders and other viewers. For example, 'M' was replaced by 'Married', and 'S' was replaced by 'Single'. Additionally, a new column called 'Age Bracket' was created to categorize age data for easier understanding.

2. **Analysis with Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**: Pivot tables and pivot charts were created to analyze various aspects of the cleaned data. Key analyses included:
   - Average income per purchase
   - Number of bikes purchased by age group
   - Commute distance of customers
   
3. **Dashboard Creation**: A dashboard was designed to visualize the insights derived from the data analysis. The dashboard included:
   - Removal of gridlines for better aesthetics
   - Placement of pivot charts to display key metrics
   - Addition of slicers to allow exploration of different factors within the data
